# HTML-to-RTF-Converter-using-MEAN

### What is RTF File?
- A file with .rtf file extension is a Rich Text Format File.
- While a normal text file stores only a plain text ,RTF File is capable of including extra information about font style,formatting images and many more
- RTF File is great for cross platform as it is supported by many applications.

### Why I develop this converter?
- Libraries that are already in npm are not supporting  many tags of the HTML.So I decided to make this converter.

### Idea--
- I noticed that if we are simply saving the html file with .rtf extension,then it is automatically getting converted in to RTF File format.So for conversion, I am  simply sending the file as an attachment with .rtf extension and is working fine for me.
